Households with income 149% of their poverty threshold include those in poverty (below 100% of their poverty threshold), plus those who have income 49% above their poverty threshold. Likewise, households with a poverty threshold of 50% include those households with income 50% below their poverty threshold.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
